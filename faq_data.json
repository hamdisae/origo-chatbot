  },
  {
    "question": "Which BOM needs to be checked first - Leading or Factory BOM?",
    "answer": "That depends on what you are responsible for; if you are the BOM Creator, you are in charge of the Leading BOM and are able to maintain the Leading BOM. If you are in charge of the Factory BOM to update yield and all the costing relevant Header Attributes you are working on the Factory BOM as these factory specific Attributes are NOT available on the Leading BOM and must be done directly on the Factory BOMs."

  {
    "question": "Manual lock/unlock of BOM - is that mandatory?",
    "answer": "No but it is recommended to be done for each of the milestones"
  },
  {
    "question": "If we rename a part is it linked to the article only?",
    "answer": "Parts are always model specific. Only the color information is article specific"
  },
  {
    "question": "Do we have a separate timeline from when the BOM part template must be correctly applied? shouldn't be any styles which already have been written/created in Flex?",
    "answer": "There is a hybrid approach that is recommended by Sourcing. The list of effected Styles is visible in the Part Template Training Manual APP and A&G. BUT it is recommended to start BOM Creation by using pre-defined Part Name per BOM LIne from the Part Templates as soon as possible because only then you have the advantage of using functions like BOM COMPARE or BLIND COPY!"
  },
  {
    "question": "Left & right part assembly is defined from wearer point of view, right?",
    "answer": "Yes, it is the same logic as today (from wearer's point of view)"
  },
  {
    "question": "Since post GL2 some attributes will still be on Flex, does that mean we need to create the source on both Flex and CP?",
    "answer": "For BOM, everything is available in Creation Portal"
  },
  {
    "question": "at present in Flex for Dual styles once a source is created we have an Initialize BOM option which helps auto create the BOM page, brings in the AD, sizing and AI files. In CP do we have any such option ?",
    "answer": "No, Tech Packs / Design Packs are not in scope of Go Live II. Nevertheless through the Leading BOM concept the BOMS are auto created for for all assigned factories and only the Factory BOM attributes need to be filled"
  },
  {
    "question": "There is no part ID in migrated BOM's correct?",
    "answer": "For the migrated BOMs we will have special IDs which clearly identifies the migrated parts"
  },
  {
    "question": "If single part ID's are updated in the part template and e.g. deleted, will they stay in the BOM's they've already been added to?",
    "answer": "The part template is not published yet. With Go Live2, it will be published and there will be no further changes to Part IDs in the near future."
  },
  {
    "question": "We have a lot of carry over styles which will not change in the next seasons. Is there any procedure for carry overs- e.g. date when we should not use migrated BOMs any more?",
    "answer": "As soon as the season is finished, the migrated BOM is done"
  },
  {
    "question": "Is it possible to update/split the part groups again? e.g. late added color blocked article?",
    "answer": "Yes, you can assign every Part Name / BOM Line to a PartGroupNumber => the grouping can be rearranged according to changes"
  },
  {
    "question": "How about \"pantone XXX\" special colour code? Is available as well?",
    "answer": "Yes, pantone XXX is open as well"
  },
  {
    "question": "For future data analysis, it would be better to not individualize too often the Part names and rather use the Part remark to specify details",
    "answer": "This is definately right. Please note that we have a very high amount of pre-defined Part Names available in the Part Template that cover the most used Parts. Only if there is no pre-defined Part Name available there should be a rewritable Part Name used."
  },
  {
    "question": "So yield under Trim for Embroidery is empty then?",
    "answer": "This is done by the Costing and the Material team and it is costed only once"
  },
  {
    "question": "How does the BOM know that I want to change the label only so I don't need a change request? I.e., does the \"Edit\" button still work in buy-ready?",
    "answer": "Yes, for APP and A&G the Edit button on the Live BOM is always active and visible - But specific BOM functions / sections are frozen for updates. Labels can always be updated - even without creating a Change Request."
  },
  {
    "question": "Could one article belong to 2 different article groups?",
    "answer": "No, but articles can be moved between article groups"
  },
  {
    "question": "Why is the name mentioned in capital letters once and in the selection with small letters?",
    "answer": "That depends on the way you type the name into the search field"
  },
  {
    "question": "I have one general concern here, when you change part group#, understood it changes in both seasons, But Now an additional work has to be done by both T1 & CCDA to get both tech pack and BOM aligned on change part group# on tech pack in both seasons",
    "answer": "This is a process question. The BOM info should always be alined with the TechPack info as it is today in Flex as well - As design is giving Part Number info already in the Handover, the Development Team can just take the info as base for the BOM Cration. The most important Material is the Main Material as PartGroupNumber 10 and that is normally the case."
  },
  {
    "question": "It is not possible to delete a group again, right?",
    "answer": "Yes, that is correct. But we'll have an improvement that allows you to hide it"
  },
  {
    "question": "Is my understanding correct that any change in BOM(leading/factory) in a CO season will never reflect to past? If it reflects, in which cases?",
    "answer": "Yes, your understanding is correct. The only exception is adding part (non seasonal) will be added in a CO season it is added from Initial season onwards, but adding the material (seasonal) will be only from C/O season onwards and will be not applied to inital season"
  },
  {
    "question": "Can this be used as well for white and grey down filling?",
    "answer": "yes - if it makes sense to differentiate these 2 elements"
  },
  {
    "question": "what about different waistband elastic height for different garment sizes? Have 3 diff. trim ref# and cost sheets per size group anyway",
    "answer": "For size reasons only, you would indicate your sample size in the part and you would put the heights for the different sizes in the remarks. We need this from a sustainability perspective to correctly calculate the weight"
  },
  {
    "question": "Is the 'clone' function the same as we had it in PDM?",
    "answer": "yes, this is somehow group articles by using clone materialway function in PDM , but more restrictive what can be changed to follow the data quality guidelines"
  },
  {
    "question": "if we have lined / non-lined possible for swim, why can't we have that as general allowed for all BU's?",
    "answer": "It is okay to use this use case as a template for other use cases that have similar guidelines (i.e. tennis shorts with or without lining)"
  },
  {
    "question": "if an item is not on a BOM line but only on part remark, will it be included in dl/ forecasting for T2?",
    "answer": "No it is not included because you don't need it for your prototype and suppliers for production will transfer it to their order system."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where should the new yield consumption of pno10 for MGH/DGH articles be entered? If I have different yield for?",
    "answer": "The yield consumption of the Variation should be entered in the 1st line of the effected PartGroup# (with light blue background) in the Factory BOM as well. => the Calculation of the Cost is per line with the price of the Variation Material/Trim etc."
  },
  {
    "question": "Will the Article always move inbetween Article Groups as previously entered no matter how often you change it?",
    "answer": "Yes, if the Article is rearranged in its Default Article Groups again it will find back to the place it was placed before it was moved to an additional Article Group."
  },
  {
    "question": "If I create a variation, put all information for heather and then move it back to default group and remove that variation, how would the updated main material information be shown under the default group line?",
    "answer": "The Article will be shown under the default group again and adopts the actual Material Ref# and Supplier of the Default Group. Only the Color Name should be moved to Default Group as well."
  },
  {
    "question": "So any seasonal changes/variations are done in FTY BOM only, right? Never in leading BOM of a c/o??",
    "answer": "No - it depends on the variation type where the Variation is located: on Factory BOM you can change Seasonal Attributes like Material or Supplier - these Attributes can be overwritten by the T1.\nAll Changes that will affect the Leading BOM and change the structure for all Seasons and Sourced like adding a Part, Changing a Color (look at List of Non-Seasonal Attributes) the Change must be done on the Leading BOM. If the change is not valid from the initial Season onwards there the newly added lines stay empty for the initial season and is filled with content from that season onwards where it was needed."
  },
  {
    "question": "Has anything changed compared to BOM Variations befroe Creatioon Portal",
    "answer": "Nothing has changed in terms of guidelines. However, the BOM and its functionalities have been improved and are now way easier to handle/work with"

    "question": "Is it correct that Seasonal Variations only apply after buy ready state?",
    "answer": "Sesaonal Variations after buy ready, for carry over articles"
  },
  {
    "question": "Can I see material changes and factory changes at the same time?",
    "answer": "You can see it in the same model, but you constantly have to switch between Material and Factory"
  },
  {
    "question": "How many BOM's can be compared at the same time?",
    "answer": "Two"
  },
  {
    "question": "Does that mean, that the BOM copy function is not existing yet?",
    "answer": "The copy function is already very far in its development and the tech team is working on finishing it until Go-Live II"
  },
  {
    "question": "Only thing which should not work on BOM copy is to copy a migrated BOM into a new BOM, right?",
    "answer": "You are able to copy the migrated BOM data into a new style - system wise this is possible but it doesn't make sense as you can not re-work the migrated BOM Data as the Part Names and their ID numbers are not suitable for new BOMs and can not be maintained. As soon as you change sth in the existing migrated BOM line you have to substitute this line with a new one from Part Template and you can not guarantee good data qualitiy of \"mixed\" Boms."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do developers know if the BOM is passed for preconfirm but fail for BR? how to track to make sure all items pass for BR before promoting to BR while system doesnt show what is fail for BR?",
    "answer": "The column 'Resolve before' shows what still needs to be resolved. As long as it is not resolved, the column will still indicate it and will not be empty"
  },
  {
    "question": "So quick check and full check happens at the same time when saving changes?",
    "answer": "The quick check happenes when you click save. After that, the full check will run"
  },
  {
    "question": "Only difference between is full check will be executed once any errors are fixed after the quick check, right?",
    "answer": "That is one difference; the other one is that the full check is also looking for all future lifecycle states and not just at the current one"
  },
  {
    "question": "Will this mass upload include multi-color material? If not, who will do the manual update in BOM?",
    "answer": "No, due to technical limitations, neither the \"as is\" nor the \"to be\" material may be multicolor materials. The manual update should be done by whoever is updating the BOM normally. Usually this is the Factory Developer."
  },
  {
    "question": "All factories will receive a comment about mass change like currently?",
    "answer": "It is not possible to automatically receive a notification as the overall notification functionality has not been developed yet. Comments are also not automatically created because they have not been implemented in Creation Portal yet."

  },
  {
    "question": "if i cannot find my style in the approval screen due to some unknown reason, can i go to the style detail to manually promote lifecycle?",
    "answer": "No that is not possible. Users can not promote the lifecycle - the required signatures need to be there before the system triggers the promotion automatically"
  },
  {
    "question": "can I somehow request signatures of the other parties via system if they are still pending and required?",
    "answer": "This is already on our list of imrpovements. We will check again if and by when we can implement it, As workaroud you can use the buy ready report to review the signatures which are already set,"
  },
  {
    "question": "If style BR is signed off by LO/T1 in approval screen, will the status of \"LO/T1 style style approval\" under style status automatically switch to YES?",

    "question": "Where can I filter for the BR date?",
    "answer": "You can sort by earliest buy ready date or use the specific filter"
  },
  {
    "question": "In the approval screen, as long as user approve style, it is disappear, and we don't have overview which style/article is pending signature approval from the other two approvers, and may miss it till BR date pass. Is there any suggestion how we can better track this?",
    "answer": "As workaroud you can use the buy ready report to review the signatures which are already set,"
  },
  {
    "question": "can we approve / sign several articles at once (like on the CWA screen in PDM right now) or only one by one?",

Thanks.",
    "answer": "If you have an article that's Buy Ready and you need to add a part/material in a carryover season, you add a part with CABR, but leave the material blank in the original season. Then you add the material in the carryover season.\n_x000D_\nCarryovers are only validated in the original season - that means this material will not be validated at all. Instead, when you add it, you have to be certain it's allowed. It is a fairly rare case and should only be done if it's certain that the material should be used. Validation won't cause any issues if the material is blank in the original season. If the material is the same one as in an existing part group, I think it would make sense to have a separate part group: one for the part only required in c/o seasons, and one for all the parts valid for all seasons."

The validation is done for rules for the current lifecycle and also looking to the future, for rules of the upcoming lifecycle states. \"Full check is not run if all articles are carryovers or dropped\" means that if every article in the model is either a carryover or is dropped, then the full check will not be run."

    "question": "the thickness should be defined already after material selection, how come the thickness can be override and the material shows still released with any thickness? current DTR is test based on different thickness.\n_x000D_\nFor example: hulex mono plus reflective - it might be released with 0.5mm thickness, but rejected with 0.3mm thickness?dy after material selection, how come the thickness can be override and the material shows still released with\nany thickness? current DTR is test based on different thickness.",
    "answer": "In some cases, we need to be able to select an Addition that overrides the initial information (like width) coming from MLM. It was only possible for us to open it up for all Additions or none for now. In cases where the DTR is based on a certain value, like with thickness, please do NOT select a new thickness in the BOM, but keep the one that comes with the material from MLM."

    "question": "CIF auto filled function in BOM not working in CP Biz server.",
    "answer": "This is really dependent on which T1-T2 combinations you are having in the BOM. Also today in Flex, not every combination is in the look-up table and will therefore automatically be filled. That is why we are having the OVR field in the new Digital BOM to enter the CIF if it´s not appearing automatically."

    "question": "mold code (heel counter) and print code (woven label) as addition: are they must have to be selected? usually heel counter and woven label are created specifically with different MLM ID already to differentiate.",
    "answer": "See BOM Writing Guideline #18 for details. They are not mandatory from a system perspective. Mold codes can still be selected as an Addition, but in Creation Portal, it just looks like a pulldown. You can find the Material Mold Code column in the Edit Leading BOM view. The same is for the Print Code."
